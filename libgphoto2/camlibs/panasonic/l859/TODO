TODO

  being disconnected properly, if the speed was

  For example: specifying an invalid image #
- quite of bit of testing has been done, but more
  is needed
- support for the image capture features of the
  camera
- cleanup.  The driver was based on the Panasonic
  DC1000 driver.  Much of the structure of the
  file is still inherited and needs to be reworked
- JPEG image created by camera appears to be an
  older format (missing JFIF header tag).  Possibly
  convert to new format?  Probably not.
