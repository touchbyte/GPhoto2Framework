CONCERNING 0x2770:0x9051 CAMERAS:

First, a general remark. The reader is strongly encouraged to read.
README.905C as well as this file. That file in fact pertains to all of the.
cameras which are supported by libgphoto2/camlibs/digigr8. All of what it says
pertains to the 0x2770:0x9051 cameras, too, unless something to the contrary is
stated below.

As of 12/17/2010, the only known camera with USB ID string 0x2770:0x9051 is the 
"Lego Bionicle," apparently produced by Digital Blue for Lego. Its 
functionality is very basic. On the package it says the camera is able to take 
40 photos, but in fact the number of photos is variable. For, they are all 
compressed. 

On 01/12/2012 the Digital Blue Barbie Camera, has been discovered, too. Except
for the name and the camera case, it seems identical to the Lego Bionicle.

Since the compression algorithm is the same as that in the 0x905C cameras, this  
camera is quite usable, for what it is. Resolution for this camera in still 
mode appears to be nonadjustable and fixed at 640x480. 

The camera has two buttons on it. one on the top and one on the rear. The 
button on top is the shutter button, of course. The button on the rear is 
often called the "mode" button on other cameras, and it will do such things
as to switch the resolution mode, the compression mode, the continuous shooting
mode, and such. But that is on other cameras. Here, that button is a "delete"
button and will perform no other function -- well, none except to turn the
camera on if it is in power-off mode and the user is adventurous.

To start the camera in stillcam mode, first look at the indicator window on the
back. If it is blank, the camera is off. Press the shutter button. It can also 
work to press the "Delete" button quickly and let go. But holding the "Delete"
button down will start the deletion of photos.

To delete the last photo, press the "Delete" button and watch the LCD indicator
window on the rear of the camera. The number of photos shown there will 
decrease by one. To delete all, hold the button down longer. The photos will be
deleted then, one by one, starting with the last one. The LCD window will show 
the decreasing number of photos while the button is being held.

To the best of my ability to determine, the camera has no clip option, 
no delayed-shooting option, and no multi-frame clips intended for AVI images.
As a still camera it will do still photos only, and those will be of dimensions
640x480. 

This camera also supports the option "gphoto2 --capture-preview" which 
means that the camera shoots an image which is immediately downloaded, not
being stored on the camera at all. If gphoto2 --capture-preview is done, then
the resulting frame comes out of the camera at 320x240 resolution. This 
resolution setting is in fact adjustable. Those who are curious may consult

/linux(recent version)/drivers/media/video/gspca/sq905c.c

where resolution-choosing is completely supported. That file supports the
"webcam" functionality of all the cameras which are supported in still mode in 
libgphoto2/camlibs/digigr8. That is, these cameras work as webcams, too.
The resolution settings which are supported in webcam mode are 
640x480, and 320x240.


WARNING: The --capture-preview option *will* delete all photos on the camera.


The option gphoto2 -D is therefore supported, too. However, the user should
note that the USB command to delete is the same as the USB command to shoot a
frame (gphoto2 option is --capture-preview). Again. If you shoot a frame with
the Lego Bionicle, it will delete whatever photos are on the camera !!!


WARNING: Use of the camera as a webcam will delete all photos on the camera, 
too !!!
