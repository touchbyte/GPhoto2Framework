CONCERNING 0x2770:0x9052 CAMERAS

First, a general remark. The reader is strongly encouraged to read
README.905C as well as this file. That file in fact pertains to all of the
cameras which are supported by libgphoto2/camlibs/digigr8. All of what it says
pertains to the 0x2770:0x9052 cameras, too, unless something to the contrary is
stated below.


The only camera known to use the ID 0x2770:0x9052 a Disney Pix Micro camera. It
seems to be a VGA version of the smaller camera with the same name, which 
reports itself as 0x2770:0x9050. The new camera has the resolution settings 
640x480 and 320x240. Both cameras permit deletion of all photos. The same 
operations are used for that as for the capture of an image to the computer
(that is, the gphoto2 --capture-preview operation). The user is therefore 
advised that the --capture-preview operation will also clear the camera's 
memory and remove all images stored there. 

The camera also has kernel support for webcam mode. To run the camera as a
webcam will also delete all still photos stored in the camera.

For further details please consult the file README.9050.
