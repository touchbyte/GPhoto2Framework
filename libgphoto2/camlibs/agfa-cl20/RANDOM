Just some random ramblings :-)


-------------------

Why does the damn windows software poll the camera so often? 
Answer: Because of the stupid "print" button on the camera!
It does not use an interrupt or anything, but you have to send:

usb_control_msg( cl20_dev, 0xC1, 0x00, 0x0000, 0x8985, data, 1, 5000);
	which is:	C1 00 00 00 85 89 00 01

If *data now contains "0", nothing happend.
If *data is now "8", the user is PRESSING the button.

Notice I say "PRESSING" :-) it has no memory, if you miss the moment the
user presses the button, you do not see it! 

-------------------

If you have a low quality picture on the camera, downloading the
thumbnail is the same transaction as downloading the whole picture.
Even worse, it's only 16k! So it's quite low resolution :-)

-------------------

If you are using the compactflash card, data download is a proper
JPEG file, ready to use.

If you are NOT using the compactflash card, data download is a so
far meaningless heap of garbage !! You can get the picture, no
problem, but you have to know how to process it for it to be useful!

-------------------

There are only a few different USB commands used, with slightly different
parameters. I have good hopes for this camera :-)

-------------------

For the first time (for me) USB snoopy actually saw the USB transactions
used when using the CL20 as a webcam (in streaming mode).

-------------------

Camera has 1 configuration, which is set as 1 (so do not start counting at 0!)
Camera has 2 interfaces, "dmesg" should show you all info you could ever need
, and it shows interface 1 (which is 0) only has Iso endpoints, whereas 
interface 2 (which is 1) has a bulk endpoint. Iso's are used for streaming
video, and bulk is used for downloading picture data. It should be possible
(the latest Agfa windows driver claims this) to use interface 1 and 2 at
the same time, i.e. downloading pictures while also streaming video. 
#TODO verify this, it was late when I read it, could be wrong :-)

-------------------

When the camera erases all pictures, my guess is it is actually just sending
the command to delete the last picture until there are no pictures left :)
