	* Version 0.02

	* Added support for different header types in returned image as
	observed by Vasileios Zografos, on @xia (different faceplate from
	mine).

	* Version 0.03 

	* Logitech pocket digital - previously someone had marked this as a 
	compatible camera, whereas it wasn't really (different USB id and
	everything!)

	* Anyway - the logitech has a fairly different protocol, so I've added
	support for that, with the caveat that logitech's imaginary 1024x768
	images are downloaded as 640x480 (the size they're stored on the 
	camera).  If you want to double the size, use the gimp!
