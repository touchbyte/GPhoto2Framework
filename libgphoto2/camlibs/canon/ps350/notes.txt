Some notes about a driver for the PS 350/A5/...


- When I use the M$Win driver on my 486DX50 laptop, it gets to 115200 but
  then has much problems getting even one thumbnail. It would be nice to
  be able to force the speed to lower bitrates. Or: default 115200 unless
  otherwise indicated (trying all possible speeds as the M$Win driver does 
  is quite useless IMO).

- I don't know if gphoto already does this, but I'd like a program that
  just copies all images off the camera without user intervention. Maybe
  a few simple commandline options, no GUI.
