========================================================================
List of work that still has to be done on this driver:
========================================================================

 - switch the camera on again when application exits

 - make file upload work with different file types and names

 - handle thumbnails and sound annotations in a more generic way to
   reuse the code

 - extend file attributes from 1 octet to 2 octets

 - introduce and use capabilities everywhere (how?)

 - the canon_int* functions often shouldn't use gphoto2 structures
   the canon_usb* and canon_serial* should even less

 - handle rotated images correctly (how?)

 - A5 support is completely broken, with the new filename based API, the 
   directory caching mecanism must be completely revisited. On the
   other hand, when removing the internal caching layer, we perhaps
   facilitated the solution to this problem.


========================================================================
List of work that has already been done:
========================================================================

 - make misc. models work on A/C adapter (e.g. G1, Pro 90 IS) [done -swestin]

 - make image capturing work [done -swestin]

 - make sure thumbnail download work on serial cameras 
   [done according to Philippe -hun]

 - getting other info on file (resolution and stuff)
   using the new libexif [done -fredrik]

 - rework configuration dialog (also wrt i18n) [done -hun]

 - switch the camera keys and buttons off while connected [done -fredrik]

 - made file upload work [done -hun (Patch from Matthias Kramm)]

 - make sure serial cameras work with new CameraFS based code
                      [basically works, according to Philippe -hun]

 - deleting files [done -hun]

 - setting attributes in general [done -hun]

 - set "downloaded" attribute after successful download [done -hun}

 - make CameraFilesystem distinguish between files and folders [done -hun]

 - FOLDERS : folders are not supported on the A50 (users have no control on
   the directory where images are stored on the compact flash) so for the
   moment the internal directory structure is hidden to gphoto2. [done -hun]

 - make downloading raw images work [done -hun]


========================================================================
Old stuff that is already done was moved down a bit by hun:
========================================================================

08/08/2000 - Notes by Philippe Marzouk <philm@users.sourceforge.net>
 - The driver must be changed to be able to talk to various cameras
   via the Camera *camera struct with each function call (08/15/2000 - done).
 - USB support is broken as libgpio got changed a bit. I can't test it as
   I don't have USB :-( (08/20/2000 - done).
 - Uploading : I'm working on it but there are problems. I will soon 
   include the preliminary support I got for people with S10 and S20 to test
   as it seems easier to get them working (s10sh does it).
   (08/22/2000 - done for serial but slow)
 - The configuration dialog has to be made with the new toolkit independent
   functions provided by gphoto2. It should use gp_config_get and
   gp_config_set to retrieve and store its configuration information.
   I think it should include : date, owner, battery status, firmware 
   revision and Compact flash space used/available.
   I don't know if anything else is needed (08/15/2000 - mostly done).
 - Starting a Changelog file (done).
