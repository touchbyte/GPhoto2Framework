Hi

In follow up to my last message regarding Nikon s6800 settings I have now
also been able to connect a Nikon Coolpix s3700 successfully and the
relevant information is below/attached.

For some reason initially I was getting an error with gphoto2 and I think it
may be the device initially connected as memory storage(?)

Initially lsusb gave USB PTP Class Camera           usb:001,007

Afterwards(?) lsbusb gave USB PTP Class Camera           usb:001,011

I discovered the PTP property 0xd002 is image mode with values and output as
follows;

7 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - FINE, Compression 1/4, Size - 5152x3864 -
20MP (approx. 7.8MB)

6 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 5152x3864 -
16MP (approx. 4.2MB)

5 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 3648x2736
- 10MP (approx. 2MB)

4 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 2272x1704 -
4MP (approx. 0.9MB)

3 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 1600x1200 -
2M (approx. 450kB)

2 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 640x480
-VGA (approx. 130kB)

1 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 5120x2880 -
15MP (approx. 3.2MB) (16:9)

0 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 5120x2880 -
15MP (approx. 3.2MB)

Do you know what these properties could be for?

Property 0xd407:(read only) (type=0x6) 1

Property 0xd406:(readwrite) (type=0xffff) ''
