					Coolpix MC-EU1 Protocol

Here are some informations about the serial protocol used between the Coolpix and the MC-EU1 remote.
Speed is set to 19200 bauds

* Introduction
This protocol use 1 or 4 bytes "packets". 4 bytes packets are used to send command to the coolpix and receive information from it.
1 byte packet are used as acknowledge (0x86), not acknowledge (0x15), "attention packet" (0xFF). 
Each byte in these packet is divided in two part, bit 0-6 is the value on 7 bits and bit 7 is the odd parity bit (thanks Mark Roberts !)
Returned value by the coolpix (in the two or three? last byte) have 0x1C offset, and least signifiant byte is sent first, for example
the number of picture is :

nb picture = ((byte[2] & 0x7F) - 0x1C) + 100 * ((byte[3] & 0x7F) - 0x1C) 
byte[0] == 0x9B, byte[1] == 0x10

* Going to MC-EU1 protocol

Send                             	Receive				Informations

0x00

					0x15

0x1B,0x53,0x06,0x00,0x00,0x11,0x02,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x13,0x00		Standard SetSpeed to 19200 command packet

					0x06

0x1B,0x53,0x06,0x00,0x00,0x11,0x02,0x00,0x00,0x10,0x23,0x00		Go to MC-EU1 protocol packet, switch LCD ON

					0x06

At first connection after Coolpix has been powerup, first 0x00 don't work, coolpix respond 0xFF 0xFF then nothing
A second 0x00 do the job.

* Go back to standard protocol

Send                             	Receive				Informations

0x9B, 0x8A, 0x1C, 0x1C							LCD OFF
				
					0x86
					
* "Attention" packet 0xFF from coolpix

Coolpix send 0xFF in many cases :
- After initialisation in response to 0x00.
- When Coolpix self powerdown (powersave)
- When Coolpix is powerdown
- When a picture has been recorded
- When mode selector is operated (A-Rec, M-Rec, Play)

It's a good idea to send 0x9B, 0x08, 0x1C, 0x1C packet to check
if coolpix has powerdown when a 0xFF is received, else check the
picture number and current mode.

* Notes

- Camera send NAK (0x15) in response to bad command packet
