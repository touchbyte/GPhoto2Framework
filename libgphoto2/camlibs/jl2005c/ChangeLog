	* *.[c,h]:   The camera of Patrick Simmons is determined to be a 
		     JL2005D. Support is introduced for distinguishing the 
		     B, C, and D versions in the places where that is needed. 
		     Support is added for downloading an arbitrary photo from
		     the list of photos in the camera. 
		     NOTE: All these cameras use compression, and how to 
		     decompress is still unknown. Thus, raw files only.

		   much works exactly right. Driver will download data 
		   without freezing the camera, and that's about it.
