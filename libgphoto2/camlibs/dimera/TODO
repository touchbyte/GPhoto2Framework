Outstanding items in the gphoto2 dimera driver:

- make sure multiple, simultaneous requests are handled properly and
disallowed where necessary (e.g. downloading image)
- add delete file function

Bugs:

- flash capacity in --summary shows 0 for newer flash cards
- image quality is lower than it could be due to suboptimal Bayer CCD
conversion routine
- some serial port speed settings don't work
- figure out how to tell if a valid image is in RAM and only put temp.ppm 
into the file list then
