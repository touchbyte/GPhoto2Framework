2008-03-24   Theodore Kilgore <kilgota@auburn.edu>

	* library.c: added Wild Planet Digital Spy Camera, contributed by 
		     Jorma Laaksonen <jorma.laaksonen@tkk.fi>

	* library.c: Processing of AVI output changed, so that output is 
		     written to file one frame at a time, to reduce 
		     memory footprint. 

2007-12-09   Theodore Kilgore <kilgota@auburn.edu>
	* library.c: Added Genius Smart 300. Thanks to 
		     Norayr Chilingaryan <gnorayr@gmail.com>
		     for reporting the camera and for testing. New camera 
		     uses optional compression and uses an offset in the 
		     still photos, but not in frames for AVI output. 
		     Also changed from using the USB Product number to
		     distinguish between camera models and will use the 
		     firmware version code reported during sonix_init()
		     instead. So the ID-ing of cameras is moved from 
		     camera_init() to sonix_init()
		     Also cleaned up the camera_capture function. 
	* sonix.c:   Incorporated above changes in sonix_init().
	* sonix.h:   Changed fwversion variable from 1 byte to the 4
		     actually reported.
