            http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-browse?sh=1&dir=/pub/os2/dev/emx/v0.9d

libraries : pthreads
            unfortunatly I don't know whih version I use here but the one from netlabs should be working
            ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/pthreads/

make sure the emx\lib directory is added to your lib environment 'SET LIB=x:\EMX\LIB'
alse the pthreads DLL's and LIB's should be in the EMX tree
