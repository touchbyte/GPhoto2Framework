This list of testers is intended for driver developers to 
find people with the required types of cameras to test their drivers.
Therefore it is sorted by the camera type.

USING THESE NAMES AND ADDRESSES FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE THAN DEVELOPMENT
AND TESTING OF SOFTWARE FROM THE gphoto PROCJECT IS STRICTLY
PROHIBITED. (Just in case anybody gets stupid ideas.)

If you create some changes to a special driver and have to test the 
driver on a type of camera you do not have direct access to, you may 
contact these nice folks.

If you have a camera not yet on this list and want to help develop the 
gphoto project, we ask you to join the testers. Just tell us at 
<gphoto-devel@lists.sourceforge.net> to include you on this list.

This will mean your name and e-mail will be distributed with every
source copy of gphoto2 and be published at http://gphoto.org/. 

It will also mean that you will test software that is UNTESTED AND
POSSIBLY DANGEROUS TO YOUR HARDWARE OR YOUR HEALTH. You will do this
on YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY. 

But it will also mean that you will be able to help develop the driver
and possibly be the first one to test the long-awaited working driver
:-)

This said, we developers also continually test our software risking
thousands of dollars' worth of hardware and our lives. :-)
